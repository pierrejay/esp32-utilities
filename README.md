# Embedded Utilities

A collection of lightweight, header-only C++ utilities for embedded systems and industrial IoT.

Most utilities are written in vanilla C++ with minimal dependencies. Originally developed for ESP32 with Arduino framework - some components may depend on Arduino (String, Serial...) or FreeRTOS (tasks, semaphores, queues).

See individual components for specific requirements and documentation.
